title: "Turkey's Hold Window Is a Fraction of Brisket's — Same Cooler, Same Math"
description: "I planned a turkey hold the way I plan a brisket hold and nearly served a bird that had drifted into the danger zone at the table. The same cooling formula, the same cooler, and a pull temperature 40+ degrees lower changes everything."

Pulled a turkey at 160°F an hour before guests showed up, wrapped it the exact same way I wrap a brisket — foil, towels, into a pre-warmed cooler — and figured I had my usual cushion if dinner ran late. Dinner ran late. Went to carve and the breast had dropped further than felt right for "an hour in a faux cambro." Checked it against a thermometer instead of trusting the clock, and it had already slid close to the floor I didn't think I'd have to worry about for hours yet. Same cooler, same wrap, same technique that buys a brisket most of an afternoon — and it very nearly wasn't enough for a bird that had barely rested.

## One formula, four hold profiles, every protein

The site's rest engine doesn't have a turkey-specific model and a brisket-specific model — it has one formula, Newton's law of cooling, applied identically regardless of what's in the cooler:

> **T(t) = T_amb + (T_pull − T_amb) · e^(−k·t)**

The same four hold profiles back every protein on the site: a warm oven holding near 150°F (`amb: 150, k: 0.1`), a **faux cambro** — foil, towels, pre-warmed cooler (`amb: 70, k: 0.1`), a **bare cooler** with no towels (`amb: 70, k: 0.2`), and **loosely tented on the counter** (`amb: 70, k: 0.55`). The 140°F floor is the same shared `SAFE_TEMP` constant for everything that comes off a smoker. Nothing about the decay curve itself treats turkey differently from brisket.

## The gap is entirely in T0

What *does* differ, and differs by a lot, is the pull temperature the curve starts from. The registry sets brisket's `finish_temp` at 203°F and pork shoulder's at 202°F — turkey's sits at 160°F, a full 42-43°F lower. Solve the cooling formula for exactly when it crosses 140°F and that gap in starting altitude is the entire story:

| Hold | Brisket (203°F) | Turkey (160°F) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Faux cambro | ~6.4 h | **~2.5 h** |
| Bare cooler | ~3.2 h | **~75 min** |
| Loosely tented on counter | ~70 min | **~27 min** |

That faux-cambro number for brisket — about six hours — is the same figure from [the site's original hold post](/blog/faux-cambro-holding). Turkey's window on the exact same setup comes out to a little over a third of that. Not because poultry cools faster (the `k` rate constant per hold vessel doesn't change with protein at all) — because it starts barely 20°F above the 140°F line it's racing toward, while brisket starts more than 60°F above it. The exponential decay has three times less room to work with before it hits the floor.

## The calculator already knows this — it's one click away

The rest calculator isn't set up as a brisket tool with a turkey option bolted on. Switch the protein selector and `state.pullTemp` resets straight to that protein's `thermal.finish_temp` — 203°F for brisket, 160°F for turkey, no manual re-entry required. Toggle from brisket to turkey on the same hold profile and the safe window collapses in front of you, which is a faster way to internalize the gap than doing the log-and-exponent math by hand, the way I'm doing it here after the fact.

## This is the hold-side companion to the danger-zone post

[The turkey danger-zone post](/blog/turkey-danger-zone-clock) went out of its way to say it wasn't covering this: "the site's hold/rest post covers the *other* end of the cook... this is the climb, the 40 to 140°F stretch on the way up, before the meat has been cooked at all." That post is about the danger zone on the way *in* — cold meat climbing up to safe. This is the danger zone on the way *out* — cooked meat cooling back down. Same 140°F line, same shared engine, opposite direction, and turkey comes out worse off on both ends: a stricter climb-side clock per that post, and now a dramatically shorter hold-side window too.

If you're planning a turkey hold with brisket instinct, drop your actual pull temperature into the **[rest calculator](/rest-calculator)** before you commit to "an hour cushion should be fine." Six hours of brisket margin does not translate — plan the bird's hold on its own numbers, not habit carried over from red meat.
