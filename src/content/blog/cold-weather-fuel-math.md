New Year's Day, 22°F, wind coming across the yard hard enough to rock the offset's chimney flap. I loaded the firebox the same way I always do for a 12-hour brisket — figured on one 20-lb bag of charcoal, maybe a little extra for the cold, grabbed a second bag "just in case."

By hour six I was scraping the bottom of bag three, standing in the driveway at 10pm in a coat, doing the math on whether the gas station down the road was still open. The brisket hadn't even started climbing out of the stall. Cold weather didn't just make the cook slower — it made the fire itself dramatically more expensive to keep lit, and I badly underestimated by how much.

## Two multipliers, and they stack

A smoker's burn rate isn't just "cold = more fuel," it's two separate physical penalties multiplying together:

- **Ambient temperature** widens the gap between the cooker's inside air and the world outside, so more heat bleeds through the steel and has to be replaced by burning more fuel. At a mild 70°F that penalty is a 1.0× baseline. At 20°F it's **1.75×** — you're feeding the fire nearly twice as much just to hold the same pit temp.
- **Wind** strips heat off the cooker's skin through forced convection — the same reason a windy 40°F day feels colder than a still one. Calm air is a 1.0× baseline; a steady breeze is 1.25×; a properly gusty day is **1.6×**.

Those two don't add — they multiply. My New Year's cook was sitting around 22°F with genuinely nasty wind, which put me close to that 1.6× wind figure. **1.71 (cold) × 1.6 (wind) ≈ 2.7×** the ideal burn rate, on top of whatever my single-wall steel offset was already costing me for being uninsulated in the first place. A 12-hour cook that should have eaten about 18 lb of charcoal at ideal weather ate closer to **49 lb**. That's not a rounding error — that's the difference between one bag and three.

> **The model:** fuel weight = base burn rate × duration × ambient multiplier × wind multiplier × (baseline efficiency ÷ your cooker's efficiency)

## Insulation is the lever you actually control

You can't do anything about the weather once the cook has started, but the cooker's build quality changes how hard that weather hits you. The efficiency term in the model — how much of your fire's heat actually reaches the meat instead of radiating into the yard — swings a lot between designs:

| Cooker type | Efficiency (η) | My 22°F / windy 12-hr cook |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single-wall steel offset | 0.45 | ~49 lb |
| Insulated blanket / cabinet | 0.70 | ~32 lb |
| Ceramic double-wall (kamado-style) | 0.85 | ~26 lb |

Same weather, same brisket, same 12 hours — nearly half the fuel just from the cooker's walls doing more of the insulating instead of the charcoal. That gap barely shows up on a calm 70°F afternoon, where every cooker looks fine. It shows up hard on the one night a year you're cooking through a cold front, which is of course exactly when I found out about it the expensive way.

## Run the weather before you load the firebox

I now check the forecast against the **[fuel estimator](/fuel-estimator)** before I commit to a bag count, not after. Punch in your fuel type, your cooker's insulation, and the day's ambient temp and wind, and it gives you pounds and bags up front — so the "just in case" bag you throw in the truck is an actual number instead of a guess made by someone who has already run out once.
