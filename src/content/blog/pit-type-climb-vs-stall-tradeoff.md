title: "Your Cooker Trades Climb Speed for Stall Length — and Not the Way You'd Guess"
description: "Picked a pellet grill for a faster cook and it delivered — right up until the stall, which ran longer than any cook I'd done on a kamado. The site's own pit-profile math explains why the fastest cooker to the plateau is also the slowest through it."

Borrowed a friend's pellet grill for a brisket after years running an offset, expecting the fan-forced airflow to just make everything faster — set it, forget it, dinner sooner. It did hit the stall noticeably quicker than my usual cooks. Then it sat there. And sat there. By the time it finally broke, I'd spent longer stalled on the "fast" cooker than I ever had on a buddy's kamado, which is famous for being slow and gentle start to finish. I'd optimized for the wrong half of the cook.

## Two numbers, one set of pit specs

The stall model gives every cooker type three raw specs — a convective airflow coefficient, a radiant-heat multiplier, and a baseline humidity — and then does something easy to miss: it runs those three numbers through **two separate formulas**, one for how fast you climb to the stall and a different one for how long the stall itself lasts once you're there.

> **Climb drive:** pitPower = 0.7 × airflow + 0.5 × radiant, then divided against the offset smoker's own pitPower as the 1.0× baseline
> **Stall drive:** evapFactor = (1 − humidity) × (airflow ÷ offset's baseline)

Airflow shows up in both formulas, but humidity only touches the second one — and that's the whole story. A cooker with a lot of airflow and dry air gets a boost on *both* fronts. A cooker with a lot of airflow but humid air gets pushed one way on climb and pulled the other way on stall length.

## Running the four cookers

At the site's own defaults — brisket, 225°F, moderate climate, reference weight, naked — here's what the four pit profiles actually do to the numbers:

| Cooker | Airflow | Humidity | Climb to stall | Naked stall length |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pellet cooker | 1.45 (highest) | 15% (driest) | **~8.0 h** (fastest) | **~3.27 h** (longest) |
| Charcoal kettle | 1.25 | 20% | ~8.7 h | ~2.66 h |
| Offset smoker | 1.15 (baseline) | 25% | ~8.3 h | ~2.29 h |
| Ceramic kamado | 0.65 (lowest) | 45% (wettest) | **~10.4 h** (slowest) | **~0.95 h** (shortest) |

The pellet cooker and the kamado sit at exact opposite ends of the table, and it's not a coincidence — it's the same two specs driving both columns in opposite directions. High airflow and dry air push climb *and* evaporation both up. Low airflow and humid air suppress both. The cooker that gets you to the stall first is, by the same physics, the cooker that then makes you wait the longest once you're there.

## Why airflow cuts two ways

Airflow — how hard the pit moves hot air across the meat — speeds up conductive heat transfer into the meat during the climb, which is exactly why a fan-forced pellet grill or a well-drafted offset feels faster off the start. But that same moving air also strips moisture off the meat's surface faster, and the stall exists entirely because that moisture pulls heat away as fast as the pit delivers it. More airflow means more evaporation to burn through before the surface finally dries out and the internal temp starts climbing again. A kamado's sealed, low-airflow design is slow on the way up for the identical reason it's fast through the plateau — there's neither much airflow pushing heat in nor much airflow pulling moisture out.

Humidity only ever pulls one lever. It doesn't touch the climb formula at all — a humid cooker climbs exactly as fast as a dry one with the same airflow. It only shrinks the stall, by shrinking the vapor-pressure gap the meat's surface moisture evaporates into. That's why the kamado's stall (45% humid) collapses so much further than its climb rate alone would predict: airflow and humidity are both working the stall in the same direction, but only airflow is working the climb.

## Pick your patience, not just your fuel

None of the four cookers is objectively faster — they're just faster in different places. If total cook time matters more than the shape of the wait, none of this changes much; the totals land closer together than the individual phases suggest. But if you're the kind of cook who plans a schedule around "should be through the stall by 2pm," knowing which half of the cook your equipment is fast at — the climb or the plateau — is worth more than knowing its total advertised speed.

The **[stall predictor](/stall-predictor)** has all four pit profiles as a live toggle — swap between them on the same brisket and watch climb time and stall length move in opposite directions before you decide which cooker to load up for the next one.
