title: "The Bone-In vs. Boneless Pork Shoulder Yield Gap Happens Before the Smoker"
description: "Boneless butts cost a real premium and pull a higher percentage of cooked meat — but the entire yield gap between the two cuts happens at the trim step, before either one sees smoke. Running the true cost per pound tells a different story than the sticker price does."

Grabbed a boneless butt instead of my usual bone-in for a cook last month, mostly because it was sitting right next to the bone-in at the same weight and I figured less waste, more pulled pork, worth the few extra dollars a pound. It pulled beautifully, yielded noticeably more than I remembered my bone-in cooks running. Felt like a smart trade. Then I actually ran both cuts through the site's yield math side by side and found out the premium I paid bought me less than I thought — not because the boneless butt cooks differently, but because it doesn't cook differently at all.

## Same cook, different cut — until you check the numbers

The registry's yield matrix for pork shoulder keys two things off the cut you buy: **trim** loss and **cook** loss. Trim is the fraction removed before the meat ever goes in the smoker — for bone-in, that's the blade bone plus extra fat-cap trim; for boneless, it's just a lighter trim pass since the bone (and the trim work of getting it out) is already done at the butcher. Cook loss is what happens during the actual smoke — rendering fat, evaporating moisture.

Here's the part that doesn't show up until you look at the matrix directly: the cook-loss numbers are **byte-for-byte identical** for both cuts.

> bone_in: trim 12% · cook (naked 42% / paper 38% / foil 34%)
> boneless: trim 6% · cook (naked 42% / paper 38% / foil 34%)

Trim loss is cut in half going boneless — 12% down to 6%. Cook loss doesn't move at all. Whatever wrap you pick, the smoker treats a bone-in butt and a boneless butt exactly the same once trim is done. The entire yield gap between these two cuts is decided at the cutting board, before the fire is even lit.

## Running the actual numbers

Take the site's own default 8 lb butt, paper-wrapped, at the registry's market prices — $1.99/lb bone-in, $2.99/lb boneless:

| Cut | Trim loss | Cooked weight | Total yield | True cost / cooked lb |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bone-in | 12% | 4.36 lb | 54.6% | **$3.65** |
| Boneless | 6% | 4.66 lb | 58.3% | **$5.13** |

Boneless does pull more cooked meat off the same 8 lb of raw pork — about 0.3 lb more, a real 3.7-point yield edge. But the boneless premium at the register is 50% ($2.99 vs. $1.99/lb), and that outruns the yield gain by a wide margin. **True cost per cooked pound comes out 41% higher for boneless**, even after crediting it for the better yield. You're not paying for less waste — the trim step already tells you almost exactly how much extra meat you're buying, and the per-pound premium buys more than that.

## Compare that to brisket, where grade moves both numbers

This is a structurally different situation than [what USDA grade does to brisket](/blog/prime-brisket-yield-myth). Brisket grade shifts *both* trim loss (thicker fat cap on Prime) and cook loss (marginally) at the same time — two levers moving together. Turkey's brine option moves cook loss and leaves trim untouched. Pork shoulder's cut choice is the cleanest case on the site: one lever, trim, does 100% of the work, and cook loss is a flat, cut-independent constant layered on top of whichever trim number you start with.

That's useful, because it means the bone-in-vs-boneless decision reduces to a single question you can actually answer before you buy: is the convenience of a boneless butt — no bone to work around while pulling, no blade bone taking up freezer space — worth a real, calculable price *and* true-cost premium? It's not a wash, and it's not free convenience either.

## Run your own weight and wrap

The trim gap is fixed at 12% vs. 6%, but your price per pound at the counter probably isn't the site's defaults, and your wrap choice changes both cuts' cooked weight by the same amount either way. The **[pork shoulder calculator](/pork-shoulder-calculator)** runs this exact trim-then-cook model — plug in your own weight, cut, wrap, and local pricing, and watch the true cost per cooked pound move before you decide which butt goes in the cart.
