First turkey I ever smoked, I sat out by the cooker with a beer, waiting for the stall. By that point I'd run enough brisket cooks to know the rhythm — climb, climb, climb, then that long flat stretch in the 150s where you start tapping the thermometer and wondering if the battery died. So I budgeted for it. Blocked out extra time, told my in-laws dinner might slide an hour.

The stall never showed up. The breast climbed almost in a straight line from fridge-cold to done, and I pulled the bird a good ninety minutes ahead of schedule with everyone still setting the table. I'd budgeted the wrong physics for the wrong animal.

## A brisket is capped by thickness. A turkey isn't.

The reason comes down to shape, not species. A packer brisket is a flat slab — no matter how big the whole cut is, heat has to travel through roughly the same thickness to reach the center, because a bigger brisket just gets *wider*, not thicker. That's why doubling a brisket's weight barely moves its cook time: the model's fitted mass exponent for brisket sits around **-1.07**, close to the "it's really about thickness, not mass" end of the scale.

A whole turkey is a fundamentally different shape — compact and roughly round, with heat arriving from every direction at once. That's much closer to the textbook case for a solid, roughly isotropic mass, where cook time should scale like weight^(-2/3) from pure conduction. The engine's fitted exponent for turkey lands at **-0.63** — almost exactly what plain conduction predicts. Brisket is a geometry problem disguised as a meat problem, and turkey is the control group.

The missing stall follows from the same shape. The stall exists because a wet surface evaporating water pulls heat away exactly as fast as your smoker pushes it in, so the internal temp parks itself until that surface finally dries out — and that balance point is easiest to hold for hours on a *thick, slow-heating* cut sitting at 225–250°F. A turkey is thinner-walled per pound, usually run hotter (300–325°F is normal for poultry), and carries a lot less total moisture to fight through at the surface. It blows past the evaporative balance point instead of parking on it. No plateau, because there's nothing thick enough to sit still under it.

## The bird you're actually cooking is two birds

Here's the part that actually bit me on a later cook, once I'd stopped worrying about a stall that was never coming. A whole turkey isn't one piece of meat with one correct doneness — it's a thin, fast-cooking breast bolted to a slower, more forgiving pair of thighs, and they don't want the same number.

- **Breast:** pull at **160°F**. Carryover heat carries it the rest of the way to a safe 165°F while it rests. (The USDA also recognizes time-at-temperature as equivalent — roughly 3.7 minutes held at 160°F does the same job as an instant 165°F.)
- **Thighs / dark meat:** push toward **175°F**. That's not a food-safety number, it's a texture one — dark meat has more connective tissue, and it wants to render further before it stops feeling tough.

I'd used an app that gave me one "done" alert at 165°F everywhere. Breast came out perfect. Thighs were safe, technically, and also the texture of a slightly-underdone chicken thigh, which is not the compliment you want at Thanksgiving. One target temperature, applied to a bird with two different jobs to do, is the wrong tool.

## Plan around the shape, not the habit

If you're used to brisket logic — long cook, wrap around the stall, wait it out — none of that transfers. Spatchcocking (backbone removed, laid flat) opens the bird up and speeds the climb by about 35% on top of the geometry effect, which is its own scheduling variable, not a stall workaround.

Our **[turkey predictor](/turkey-stall)** models this directly as a single monotonic climb to a 160°F breast pull — no stall band, no wrap step, just the geometry and your pit temp. Run your weight and prep through it before the bird goes on, not while you're standing next to the cooker realizing you've got ninety extra minutes and a house full of hungry relatives.
