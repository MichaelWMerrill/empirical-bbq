title: "A Brisket Blowing Past the 4-Hour Danger-Zone Guideline Isn't a Mistake"
description: "Pulled up the stall predictor for an ordinary 12 lb brisket and the danger-zone note had already escalated before I'd touched a single setting. Ran the math on why that's the expected outcome, not a warning sign, for intact muscle."

Opened the stall predictor to sanity-check a Saturday cook — nothing unusual, a 12 lb packer, 225°F, offset smoker, moderate climate, the same defaults the tool loads before you touch a single control — and the danger-zone readout was already in its escalated state. Four-plus hours in the 40–140°F band, the note said, past the point where "many smoking guides advise clearing it." My first reaction was that I'd fat-fingered something. I hadn't. That's just what a completely ordinary brisket cook does to that number.

## The 4-hour figure was never a hard limit

The site tracks two constants for this: `DANGER_ZONE_FLOOR = 140` and `DANGER_ZONE_HOURS_LIMIT = 4`, and the code comment next to them is direct about what the second one actually is — "the common smoking-guide application of that principle, not a verbatim FSIS number." Cross four hours and `dangerZoneNote()` swaps in escalated copy. It doesn't say unsafe. It says *worth reading the rest of the sentence*, and the rest of the sentence is where the nuance lives.

## What the model's own default actually does

`dangerZoneHours()` doesn't estimate this — it reads the real crossing point straight off the engine's own temperature curve, the same `buildPath()`/`computeModel()` math that drives every other number on the page. Run the stall predictor's out-of-the-box settings — 12 lb, offset smoker, 225°F, moderate climate — and here's where 140°F actually lands:

> **Beef brisket:** ~8.1 hours to clear the danger zone
> **Pork shoulder:** ~9.2 hours to clear the danger zone

That's not a slow cook or a mistake — it's the calculator's default example, the numbers you get without adjusting anything. Both proteins blow past the 4-hour guideline by a factor of two to two-and-a-quarter before the meat has even reached its stall, let alone finished cooking. If crossing 4 hours meant something had gone wrong, the tool's own defaults would be flagging every single brisket and pork shoulder cook it's capable of modeling.

## Why the model doesn't call this unsafe

The reason isn't that the danger zone doesn't matter for beef and pork — it's that intact muscle carries a different risk profile than the model already treats differently elsewhere. A packer brisket and a Boston butt are **intact muscle**: whatever bacteria exist started on the surface, and a slow climb through 40–140°F puts that surface through hours of rising heat and smoke exposure the whole time, not just at the finish. That's a materially different situation from meat that's contaminated throughout, which is exactly the distinction [the turkey danger-zone post](/blog/turkey-danger-zone-clock) digs into from the other side — poultry carries the `dangerZone: true` flag in the registry specifically because it doesn't get that same benefit of the doubt. Brisket and pork shoulder don't carry that flag. The 4-hour figure escalates the copy for every protein equally, but only turkey's own safety note treats crossing it as a real departure from the plan rather than an expected Tuesday.

## Budget for it, don't panic over it

None of this is license to ignore internal temperature or food safety fundamentals — keep the meat cold until it goes on, keep the pit at a real temperature, and don't let a stall turn into a stall-out. It's narrower than that: seeing an escalated danger-zone note on a normal low-and-slow cook is the expected result of the physics, not a sign you did something wrong. A 12+ lb packer or butt at 225°F is going to sit in that band for the better part of a workday no matter how carefully you run the cook, and the model already knows that.

Run your own weight and pit setup through the **[stall predictor](/stall-predictor)** — or the [pork shoulder predictor](/pork-shoulder-stall) — and you'll see the same escalated note before you've changed anything. That's the baseline, not a red flag.
