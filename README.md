# Empirical BBQ

Physics-flavored pitmaster calculators for [empiricalbbq.com](https://empiricalbbq.com) —
yield & cost, the thermodynamic stall, cook scheduling, smoker fuel, and rest/hold — across
four proteins (beef brisket, pork shoulder, pork ribs, turkey), plus a party planner, a
brisket size calculator, a methodology page, and a science-focused blog.

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) (static output) and pre-compiled Tailwind CSS,
deployed as static assets on Cloudflare's **Workers static-assets** model (see
[Contact endpoint](#contact-endpoint) for why a Worker is in the mix at all).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # local dev server (ad slots render as labeled placeholders)
npm run build    # static build to dist/ (also generates dist/sitemap.xml)
npm run preview  # preview the production build
npm run test     # run the engine regression tests (Vitest)
```

`npm run build` runs `astro build` and then `scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs`, which
writes `dist/sitemap.xml` using the site's canonical URL forms — all
extensionless (homepage `/`, tool/util pages `/<name>`, blog index `/blog`,
posts `/blog/<slug>`).

`<lastmod>` reflects when a page's **source** last changed, never the build
date: blog posts use `updatedDate ?? pubDate` from their frontmatter, other
pages use the last commit date of their `.astro` route. A URL whose date can't
be resolved is emitted without `<lastmod>` rather than with a guessed one —
stamping every URL with "today" on every deploy trains Google to ignore the
field. This needs real git history, so **CI must not use a shallow clone**
(`git clone --depth 1`); the build warns when it detects one.

scripts/                   Build/generator scripts: sitemap, OG images, golden specs, ads.txt check,
                           cook-log-report (ad hoc D1 aggregation)
public/                    Static assets copied verbatim (favicons, ads.txt, llms.txt, _headers)
```

The site builds to `dist/`, which is what Cloudflare serves (see `wrangler.jsonc`). AdSense
slots render as clean dashed placeholders in development and as live
`<ins class="adsbygoogle">` units in production (`import.meta.env.PROD`).

## Contact endpoint

The contact form (`src/pages/contact.astro`) POSTs JSON to `/api/contact`. The request
handler lives in `server/contactHandler.ts`, wired for the live deployment model:

- **Workers static-assets (current deploy):** `worker.ts` is the Worker entry (`main`
  in `wrangler.jsonc`). Static files in `dist/` are served by the
  `ASSETS` binding; the Worker only runs for `/api/contact` and defers everything else
  (including `404.html`) to the assets.

The handler itself is deployment-agnostic: if the project ever moves back to Cloudflare
Pages, add a thin `functions/api/contact.ts` adapter
(`export const onRequestPost = (ctx) => handleContact(ctx.request, ctx.env)`) — no change to
`server/contactHandler.ts` required.

The handler validates the message, verifies a Cloudflare Turnstile token server-side, and
forwards the submission to `contact@empiricalbbq.com` via **Resend** (if `RESEND_API_KEY`
is set) or **MailChannels**.

**Environment variables** (set in the deploy environment — Cloudflare dashboard →
your project → Settings → Variables and Secrets):

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | **Yes** (runtime) | Cloudflare Turnstile *secret* key, used for server-side verification. |
| `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | Optional (build time) | Public Turnstile *site* key for the widget. Overrides the committed production default; the build fails if it resolves to a Cloudflare test key. |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Optional | If present, email is sent via Resend instead of MailChannels. |

**Turnstile site key:** the widget's *site* key (public — it ships in the page HTML) lives in
`src/pages/contact.astro` as `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`, which defaults to the committed production
key and is overridable at build time via the `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` env var (see table above). A
build-time guard throws if the resolved value is one of Cloudflare's documented **test** keys
(e.g. the "always passes" `1x00000000000000000000AA`), so a test key — which issues tokens that
always pass and would silently disable bot protection — can never ship to production. Create the
widget and both keys at Cloudflare dashboard → **Turnstile**.

> **Deployment note:** this repo deploys on the **Workers static-assets** model (config in
> `wrangler.jsonc`), and the `/api/contact` route is wired via `worker.ts` (`main`) — no
> action needed to serve it.
> `output: 'static'` in `astro.config.mjs` is unchanged; `npm run build` still just produces
> `dist/`, and the Worker is bundled by `wrangler` at deploy time. (The Pages `functions/`
> adapter was removed — see above for how to re-add it if the deploy model ever changes.)
>
> MailChannels now requires account setup (their free Workers integration was retired), so
> **Resend is the recommended path** — set `RESEND_API_KEY` and verify your sending domain.

## Cook log data layer

`workers/cook-log-service/` is a second, fully isolated Cloudflare Worker — separate deploy,
separate `wrangler.jsonc`, separate D1 database, no shared code or routes with
`pitmaster-command-center`. It collects anonymized, opt-in cook data (weight, timeline,
predicted vs. actual cook time) from PWA users. **This is data-layer infrastructure only** —
it does not include the on-device capture UI (a separate, not-yet-built feature) and it does
not feed any model recalibration (a manual, human-reviewed step; see the aggregation script
below).

**Endpoints** (no read/GET endpoint — this is a write-only API; aggregation runs separately):

| Route | Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/cook-logs` | `POST` | Create a session at cook start. Rejects (400) a missing `consented_at`, an unrecognized enum value, or a `weight_lb` outside the protein's range. Rate limited to `MAX_WRITES_PER_DAY` (20) writes/day per `anon_client_id`. |
| `/api/cook-logs/:id` | `PATCH` | Update a session's progress fields (wrap, stall markers, finish). 404s if `id` doesn't exist or doesn't belong to the requesting `anon_client_id`. |

**Data model**: `cook_sessions` in D1 (see `workers/cook-log-service/migrations/0001_create_cook_sessions.sql`).
No name, email, or precise location is ever collected — `anon_client_id` is a client-generated
`crypto.randomUUID()` stored in the PWA's local storage, never tied to an account or device
identifier. Weight bounds used for validation are read directly from
`PROTEINS[...].thermal.geometry.weight_bounds` in `src/utils/proteinRegistry.js` (the same
per-protein calculator data), not reinvented in the Worker.

**Deploying** (not yet done — this repo ships the code, not the live infrastructure):

```bash
cd workers/cook-log-service
npx wrangler d1 create cook-log-db   # then paste the returned database_id into wrangler.jsonc
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply cook-log-db --remote
npx wrangler deploy
```

The Worker also needs a public route or custom domain attached in the Cloudflare dashboard
before the (future) PWA can reach it — that attachment isn't in-repo config for
`pitmaster-command-center` either, so it's a deploy-time step, not a code change.

**Aggregation**: `scripts/cook-log-report.mjs` is an ad hoc, human-run script (not wired into
CI or any build step, and it never writes back to a model constant or golden test) that shells
out to `wrangler d1 execute` and prints, per `protein_type` + `model_version`: session count,
mean/median predicted vs. actual cook time, and the delta percentage — the numbers to look at
before deciding whether a calculator model needs recalibration.

```bash
node scripts/cook-log-report.mjs           # local D1
node scripts/cook-log-report.mjs --remote  # production D1
```

Vitest coverage for the Worker lives in `workers/cook-log-service/__tests__/`.

## Authorship & E-E-A-T

`src/utils/author.js` is the single source of truth for who wrote the site:
`AUTHOR_NAME` / `AUTHOR_ROLE` for visible bylines and `AUTHOR_SCHEMA` (a
schema.org `Person`) for structured data. It feeds the `/about` bio page, the
blog post bylines and end-of-post author box, the `author` field on blog
`Article` and methodology `TechArticle` schema, and `Organization.founder` in
the site-wide `WebSite` block. Because the visible text and the JSON-LD read
from the same module, a byline can never claim something the structured data
contradicts — which is the failure mode search and ad-quality crawlers punish.

Editorial rule for author-facing copy: **claim only what's true.** The bio
states plainly that the author is a software/data professional rather than a
chef, food scientist, or competition pitmaster, and points at `/methodology`
for the sourcing. The site's credibility is meant to rest on published sources
and inspectable math, so inflating credentials here would undercut it.

## Testing

Engine calculations are locked with golden-value regression tests (Vitest) in
`src/utils/__tests__/`:

```bash
npm run test
```

Each golden spec hard-codes expected outputs captured from the current engine — one per
protein (`brisketEngine`, `porkShoulderEngine`, `turkeyEngine`, `ribsEngine`), plus
`stallEngine` (representative pit/wrap/climate states + curve monotonicity), `fuelEngine`
(every anchor, midpoint, and fuel × insulation × wind combo), and `restEngine` (Newtonian
cooling curve + safe-hold window). Any accidental change to an engine constant fails the tests.
The specs are regenerated only on an **intentional** engine change via
`node scripts/gen-golden.mjs` (then commit the updated specs).

`crossPathConsistency.spec.js` is different — not a golden. It asserts the stall predictor
(`computeModel`) and the cook scheduler (`cookDuration`) return the same cook duration for
identical inputs across protein × pit temp × wrap × climate, so the two pages can't silently
diverge. Ribs are a declared known failure (`test.fails`): the scheduler runs the fixed
3-2-1 / 2-2-1 method while the predictor uses `computeModel`, so they disagree until ribs is
unified — at which point the declaration turns the suite red and must be removed.

## Security

- **Response headers** (`public/_headers`, applied site-wide): `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
  `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`,
  `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`, and a restrictive `Permissions-Policy`. The
  `/api/contact` JSON responses set `nosniff` directly (they bypass `_headers`).
- **Shareable links** hydrate calculator state from URL query params, but every value is
  validated — numbers are clamped to their slider range and enums are whitelisted
  (`src/utils/shareLink.js`) — so a hostile URL cannot inject unexpected state or markup.
- **Contact endpoint** (`server/contactHandler.ts`): same-origin check, server-side Turnstile
  verification (single-use tokens), message length cap, control-character stripping and length
  caps on subject fields (email-header-injection defense), and reply-to email validation.
- **JSON-LD** is emitted with `<`, `>`, `&`, and JS line-terminators escaped to unicode, so a
  schema string can never break out of its `<script>` element.
- **Content-Security-Policy** (`public/_headers`, site-wide) ships in **report-only** mode
  (`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`): browsers report violations to the console but
  block nothing, so live AdSense/Analytics revenue is never at risk while the allowlist is
  validated in production. The policy allowlists Google Tag/Analytics, the AdSense ad
  ecosystem (`googlesyndication` / `doubleclick` / `adtrafficquality`), and Cloudflare
  Turnstile, and locks down `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'self'`, `frame-ancestors 'self'`,
  and `form-action 'self'`. `script-src` includes `'unsafe-inline'` because GA/Consent Mode
  and AdSense inject inline scripts (nonces can't cover ad-injected code), and `img-src https:`
  allows ad-creative images from arbitrary advertiser hosts. **To enforce** once you've
  confirmed no legitimate violations in production, rename the header to
  `Content-Security-Policy` (drop `-Report-Only`) — `upgrade-insecure-requests` (inert and
  warned-about under report-only) then takes effect automatically.
- **`npm audit`** reports advisories in Astro/esbuild, but they apply to features this site
  does not use (`define:vars`, server islands, spread props with user data, SSR error pages)
  or to the local dev server only — none are exploitable in the static production build. The
  only offered fix is a breaking `astro@7` upgrade, which should be done as a planned,
  separately-tested change rather than `npm audit fix --force`.
